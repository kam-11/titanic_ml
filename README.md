# Titanic ML Classification (From Scratch)

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook implementing **Naive Bayes** and **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classifiers **from scratch** using Python, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

## Features

- Titanic dataset preprocessing
- Data visualization (gender/class vs survival)
- Naive Bayes Classifier (manual implementation)
- KNN Classifier (manual implementation)
- Accuracy evaluation

## Files

- `titanic_ml_from_colab.ipynb` - Final notebook with full implementation
- `train.csv` - Titanic dataset (required to run the notebook)

## Instructions

1. Clone or download the repo.
2. Make sure `train.csv` is in the same folder as the notebook.
3. Open the `.ipynb` file using Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
4. Run all cells to view results and visualizations.
